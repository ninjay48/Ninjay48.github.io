    <p>im really just putting this text here as a spacer and i didnt feel like making a div so you can kinda ignore this and admire the picture of kanye west thats floating at the top of your screen. man a div sure woulld be a lot more efficient and easier but i dont like easy and i like these little stupid info dumps so in the mean time im gonna tell you why mcdonalds is complete low tier garbage and anyone who rates them high on a fast food tierlist is weak and doesnt deserve to procreate i stg we need to start having life guards for the gene pool so we dont have people who enjoy eating mcdonalds raising children. mcdonalds is also a perfect example of why a fully capitalist society has failed us as a nation but not many poeople are ready for that converstaion because haha funny amobguis sus ding ding ding he vented vote him out stuff where we cant have a genuine conversation without a chronically online kid coming over saying omg is that a *insert controversial game series* reference as a ploy to get as many people wanting to launch a brick into their skull.  anyway divs are useless and we dont need them</p>
